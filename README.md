# Blind-Stick-Navigator

Eyes are one of the most important sense organs of the human body. Eyesight  plays a major role in collecting most of the information from the real world and that information is further processed by the brain. Blindness or visual impairment is a condition that leads to the loss of the valuable senses of vision. Worldwide there are millions of people who are visually impaired and suffer inconveniences in their daily life and social life due to this condition. There are numerous assistive devices in the market that work only when the blind stick touches the object. But there are several conditions in day-to-day life where a person needs visual information much earlier than the stick actually touching the obstacle and then giving a signal. This would help the blind person get alert and cautious beforehand so that they can make decisions faster. The existence of such a compact stick is necessary. Our project focuses on designing a device for blind people that helps them to travel independently and also it must be comfortable to use. The device will be used to help blind people to move with the same ease and confidence as sighted people.

Objectives of project:
The Blind Stick Navigator will be able to
● Detect and give signals alert about the forthcoming obstacles like
upstanding objects, potholes, water pits and puddles.
● Send out a SMS message with the GPS location of the blind with the click
of a button.
● Remotely locate the stick.
● Sense lighting conditions in the surroundings.

Results
The Blind Stick was successfully implemented using all the sensors. The
ultrasonic sensors sensed the upstanding as well as potholes and the buzzer
buzzed with the desired frequency. The RF module was able to remotely find the
stick with the help of just the click of the button. The raindrop sensor was able to
detect water puddles and give alerts as vibrations in the stick. The LDR was
implemented successfully and the LED lit up whenever there was dark.The
location of the blind person was successfully sent to their family members via
message along with the live coordinates of the person.

Conclusion:
We can confidently use the Blind stick for the needy and the visually impaired
people as it can guide them through various obstacles and even can be helpful to
them in case of emergency. The blind stick will be helpful in the following ways-
1) Help blind people to detect if there are upstanding obstacles ahead.

2) Help blind people to get alerts about potholes, digs or water puddles in front,
using various kinds of beeps.
3) Help the person to find and locate his/her stick using a buzzer if it is away.
4) Can ask help from the nearby people in a deserted place in case of trouble with
the help of an SOS light and buzzer.
5) Can send his/her location to his family members in case of being lost or in any
other emergency.
6) Can sense lighting conditions and switch on the light on the stick if it is a dark
surrounding. This would allow them to be visible to other people and avoid any
kind of accidents.
