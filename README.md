# Blind-Stick-Navigator
Eyes are one of the most important sense organs of the human body. Eyesight  plays a major role in collecting most of the information from the real world and that information is further processed by the brain. Blindness or visual impairment is a condition that leads to the loss of the valuable senses of vision. Worldwide there are millions of people who are visually impaired and suffer inconveniences in their daily life and social life due to this condition. There are numerous assistive devices in the market that work only when the blind stick touches the object. But there are several conditions in day-to-day life where a person needs visual information much earlier than the stick actually touching the obstacle and then giving a signal. This would help the blind person get alert and cautious beforehand so that they can make decisions faster. The existence of such a compact stick is necessary. Our project focuses on designing a device for blind people that helps them to travel independently and also it must be comfortable to use. The device will be used to help blind people to move with the same ease and confidence as sighted people.
